## Review Heatmap for Anki

**Overview**

Adds a **heatmap graph** to Anki's main window which visualizes past and future card review activity, similar to the contribution view on GitHub. Information on the **current streak** is displayed alongside the heatmap. Clicking on an item shows the cards reviewed on that day.
